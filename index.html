<h1>About Me:</h1>

<p> My name is Nadeem Baba. I went to Winchester Public High School in Winchester Massachusetts. Some of my favorite <br>
    hobbies and pastimes include playing or listening to music, playing basketball, and playing video games. I like to<br>
    go out with friends on the weekends and learning how to code in school. I was born in America, but my mom was born <br>
    in Morocco and my dad was born in Lebanon. My favorite food is pizza (pictured bellow).<p>
